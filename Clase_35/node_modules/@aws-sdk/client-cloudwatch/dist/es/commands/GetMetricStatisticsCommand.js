/**
 * <p>Gets statistics for the specified metric.</p>
 *
 *
 *
 * 		       <p>The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If
 * 			you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error.
 * 			To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make
 * 			multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period.
 * 			Data points are not returned in chronological order.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period
 * 			that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period,
 * 			CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each
 * 			one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than
 * 			the number of data points returned.</p>
 * 		       <p>CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish
 * 			data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve
 * 			percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:</p>
 * 		       <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 * 		       <p>Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.</p>
 * 		       <p>Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:</p>
 * 		       <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution
 * 				metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 * 		       <p>Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect
 * 			data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available,
 * 			but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with
 * 		a resolution of 1 hour.</p>
 * 		       <p>CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.</p>
