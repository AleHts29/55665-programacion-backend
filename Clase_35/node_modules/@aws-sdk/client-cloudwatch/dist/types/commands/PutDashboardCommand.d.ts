/**
 * <p>Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard,
 * 		the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.</p>
 * 		       <p>All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.</p>
 * 		       <p>A simple way to create a dashboard using <code>PutDashboard</code> is to copy an
 * 			existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard
 * 			and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON  block
 * 			for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to
 * 			use <code>GetDashboard</code>, and then use the data returned
 * 			within <code>DashboardBody</code> as the template for the new dashboard when you call <code>PutDashboard</code>.</p>
 * 		       <p>When you create a dashboard with <code>PutDashboard</code>, a good practice is to
 * 			add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should
 * 		not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location
 * 		of the <code>DashboardBody</code> script or the CloudFormation template used to create the
 * 		dashboard.</p>
