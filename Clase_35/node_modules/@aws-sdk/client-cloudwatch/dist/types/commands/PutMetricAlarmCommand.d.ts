/**
 * <p>Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric, metric math expression,
 * 			or anomaly detection model.</p>
 * 		       <p>Alarms based on anomaly detection models cannot have Auto Scaling actions.</p>
 * 		       <p>When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to
 * 			<code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
 * 			appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed.</p>
 * 		       <p>When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
 * 			update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>If you are an IAM user, you must have
 * 			Amazon EC2 permissions for some alarm operations:</p>
 * 		       <ul>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>The <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> for all alarms with EC2 actions</p>
 *
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 *
 * 				           <p>The <code>iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole</code> to create an alarm
 * 					with Systems Manager OpsItem actions.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *          </ul>
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 		       <p>The first time you create an alarm in the
 * 			AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch
 * 			creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked roles
 * 			are called <code>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents</code> and
 * 			<code>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchAlarms_ActionSSM</code>.
 * 			For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role">AWS service-linked role</a>.</p>
