/**
 * <p>This operation returns the time series data collected by a Contributor Insights rule. The data includes the identity and number of
 * 		contributors to the log group.</p>
 * 		       <p>You can also optionally return one or more statistics about each data point in the time series. These statistics can include the following:</p>
 * 		       <ul>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>
 *                   <code>UniqueContributors</code> -- the number of unique contributors for each data point.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>
 *                   <code>MaxContributorValue</code> -- the value of the top contributor for each data point. The identity of the
 * 					contributor might change for each data point in the graph.</p>
 * 				           <p>If this rule aggregates by COUNT, the top contributor for each data point is the contributor with the
 * 					most occurrences in that period. If the rule aggregates by SUM, the top contributor is the contributor with the highest sum in the log field specified
 * 					by the rule's <code>Value</code>, during that period.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>
 *                   <code>SampleCount</code> -- the number of data points matched by the rule.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>
 *                   <code>Sum</code> -- the sum of the values from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>
 *                   <code>Minimum</code> -- the minimum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>
 *                   <code>Maximum</code> -- the maximum value from a single observation during the time period represented by that data point.</p>
 * 			         </li>
 *             <li>
 * 				           <p>
 *                   <code>Average</code> -- the average value from all contributors during the time period represented by that data point.</p>
