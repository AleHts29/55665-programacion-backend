/**
 * <p>Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource. Currently, the only CloudWatch resources that
 * 			can be tagged are alarms and Contributor Insights rules.</p>
 * 		       <p>Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user
 * 			permissions by granting a user
 * 			permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values.</p>
 * 		       <p>Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters.</p>
 * 		       <p>You can use the <code>TagResource</code> action with an alarm that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm,
 * 			this tag is appended to the list of tags associated
 * 			with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces
 * 			the previous value for that tag.</p>
 * 		       <p>You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.</p>
